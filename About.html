    <p>My name is Abel Darasimi a professional Website developer with 3-weeks of experience  and a vast knowledge in creating website 
        layout and user interface using HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT and 
        developing a user friendly website with certified ability in developing well functioning 
        websites that improve data retrival and workflow efficiencies. My agenda is to create an
         evolutionary website that is eyecatchy and work perfectly  even when technology
          evolve.</p>
          <p>I am a curious and introspective person who have a deep passion for learning and exploration
            . I am mostly fascinated by the progrmming world and like to spend much of my free time studying and
             and troubleshooting code problems. I am also an avid reader and have 
             a vast library of progrmming languages.
            </p>
            <p>I was born in Ogun state, Nigeria, and began my education at the
                 Anglican Dieosesan Nursery School. I later attended Connrestone College, Ogun state, where i wrote my SSCE
                  in 2023 . During my time at secondary school i was heavily influenced by some of my
                  friends who love programming, which laid the foundation for my present contributions
                   to programming. In the year 2024 there was program going on in a foundation named 'Dare adeboye Innovative
                   Hub', the program was all about coding, when i heared about it i thought that was the opportunity i have been 
                   waiting for. Then i joined training and this is where i am today .
            </p>
            <p>My primary goal is to understand the programming language and uncover its secrets. I believe in the concept of a rational,
                 team work, and my works are aimed to explain and describe this codes through mathematical and statistical process.
                  I also sought to apply my knowledge to practical problems, such as navigation and communication so as to improve more knowwledge
                  and inspire a lot of up-coming youths who will like to follow my path.
            </p>
            <p>In conclusion, I want to become a towering figure in the history of Programming and designs.My  
                passion for learning, and dedication to understanding the programming language will leve a lasting legacy that continues to inspire 
                and influence programmers and designers today. My  works will serves as a testament to the power of human curiosity and the
                 importance of pursuing one's goals with determination and perseverance.</p>
